# Deploy

## SSH to server

Command line: 

`ssh username@server_adresse_ip`

Or using Filezilla
The creditentials are the same than SSH.

## Pipeline deploy.yml

The pipeline is executed at each time we push code on main branch.

Actually, o2switch not allows us to connect in SSH without configure IP Address so the pipeline has error.
